# Super Awesome (Boring Edition)

This repo does not contain a coding challenge.  It contains the frame of a coding challenge.  Here you will find all of the stuff that makes the coding challenge easy to administer, with none of the actual guts of the challenge.

If something goes wrong that prevents these scripts from running on your machine, it would be good to know about it before the interview--that way we can either address it up-front, or do something else.

## What To Do With It

As part of the challenge, you will need to run a script: `do_thing.sh`.  Later, I'll run `view_stuff.sh` to make sure that `do_thing.sh` got run.  Easy, right?

Take a look at [samplesession.txt](samplesession.txt) and run through those steps.  If you can complete them without trouble, then you're all set for the challenge.


## About the challenge itself

- The challenge assumes that you're running it on something UNIXy.  If your background doesn't contain anything UNIXy, let us know ahead of time and we'll come up with something different for you.

- It isn't designed to be mind-bending.  It's just some work I had to do the other day.  It might not resemble the work you're being considered for, but it at least resembles work that somebody (me) does at Clover.

- You can use whatever languages and tools you like.  Your code will need to do some computation, and based on the result of that computation, call a script in a certain way.

- We recommend that you bring a laptop which is set up with your preferred development environment--that way we can minimize set-up time.  If this is problematic, let us know and we'll secure a machine for you to use.
